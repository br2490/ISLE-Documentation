This Migration guide will help you migrate your existing production Islandora environment to utilize an ISLE environment for easily maintaining Islandora. This guide will walk you through how to identify and copy your institution's Islandora data and files (including your data volume, Drupal site or sites, and commonly customized xml and xslt files) to your ISLE framework.

**Please note:** There is a [Glossary](../glossary.md) with relevant terms to help guide installation.

## Assumptions / Prerequisites

* Comfortability with ISLE. Recommend first setting up the [ISLE Test Site](../02_installation_test/ild_installation_guide.md) (`isle.localdomain`). If you have already done this, please proceed.

* Host Server that conforms to the specifications outlined in the [Host Server Specifications](../01_installation_host_server/host_server_system_specifications.md).

* This Migration guide is designed for a Host server that has already followed the appropriate setup and configuration instructions in the [New ISLE section](/index.md#new-isle) of the guide.

* Instructions below also assume a MacOS or Linux laptop or workstation to be used in conjunction with the ISLE Host Server for deploying configs, code, files etc. Windows users may have to adjust / swap out various tools as needed.

* These directions also depend on the type of local computer used to connect via browser to Islandora.

* Have an existing domain name that works - is set up with DNS etc...

* Have [SSL Certificates](../glossary.md#systems) previously created for the web domain. (_Please work with the appropriate internal IT resource to provision these files for your domain_)

* Disk space on or mounted to the Host Server large enough to store a **copy** of your fedora data store

* Access to that server from your local workstation via SSH (`islandora` user with sudo privileges)

* Access to the current Islandora production server

* Usernames/Passwords for key parts of your stack which are used **for** the migration.
    * Drupal SQL information: username, password, database name can be obtained from your original `www/sites/default/settings.php`
    * Fedora SQL information: username, password, database name can be obtained from your original `fedora/server/config/fedora.fcfcg`

* SQL dump (export) of the current production site's Drupal database. Ensure that the contents of any `cache` table are not exported.

**Finally also please note:** Instructions from this guide  and it's associated checklists may call for you to **COPY** data from your running Islandora environment to a newly created folder: `current_prod_islandora_config` located on your ISLE Host Server or local workstation called `Local ISLE config laptop`. You will then work from this copy for future steps. In some cases, you'll need to copy configurations down to your laptop / workstation (`Local ISLE config laptop`) and merge contents as directed. (_if necessary_) In other cases, due to the size of the data e.g. Fedora data you may only be able to copy production data to the target ISLE Host server (`Remote ISLE Host server`) instead of your local laptop. Please attempt to balance as necessary when putting together the `docker-compose.yml` and config directory. Most instructions will attempt to direct you to copy to a local workstation. ultimately you will be putting this config in a git repository to deploy to the remote ISLE host server for everything to work with both your copied data and merged production settings.

**Recommend:** Having adequate storage space available for the ISLE host server to accommodate a working copy of a production Islandora's associated configurations and data.

## Overview

**TL;DR** Copy old stuff over to host server and local laptop w/ checklist, create new private repo for configs, edit tomcat.env and .env, edit docker-compose.yml to point to new data locations, spin up containers, go into fedora container & reindex, qc site - Done.

* Create a new directory on your remote ISLE Host server for the /data folders and files

* **COPY** the drupal/islandora site and configuration files from the running production Islandora
    * (following the [Migration Export Checklist](migration_export_checklist.md)).

* Create a new directory on your local laptop for the /config folders and files, copy the ISLE repository /config into it, and make this into a private repository.

* Edit the /config files so they have the proper site-specific information
    * (following the [Migration Merge Checklist](migration_merge_checklist.md)

*  **NOTE** Some of this will involve fairly complicated merging of files to account for custom edits that may have been made to your production Islandora site and/or to bring configuration files up to work with newer software versions. This is by far the trickiest part of the migration and definitely a good place to seek help from the community if you get stuck.

* Edit the docker-compose.yml file to point to all these fine new config files.
* Download ISLE images from Dockerhub and spin up the ISLE Containers (takes a while depending on network speeds)
* Go into the fedora container and do a re-indexing (takes a little while)
    * (following the [Migration Reindex Process](migration_reindex_process.md)).
* Go to the new site and QC!

## Detailed Steps

* Setup a Private Code Repository
      * Most of the work in this guide involves editing of the .env and tomcat.env that customize the pieces of Islandora (database, repository, web-server, etc...).
      * Doing this work in a code repository makes it easier to correct errors and to repeat the process for additional servers without needing to replicate all the work.
      * Since the edits will include things like passwords, it's important to make this a private repository.

* Customizing for your Environment
      * Many of the steps below describe adding the domain name or other specific bits of information into files or appending those bits to file names.
      * In these cases this guide will call out the customization point AND provide an example - it's important not to literally copy paste the example!
      * Your best guide for these customizations are the source files from your currently running Islandora environment.

### Create Private Code Repository

**ON your local laptop/workstation:**

* On the repository of your choice (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) create a PRIVATE remote git repo - see the specific code repository documentation online for setup instructions.

* Open a terminal - navigate to `/opt/ISLE` or where you cloned the ISLE directory on your local workstation.

* Within the ISLE directory type: `git remote add NameOfYourRepository URLofYourRepository`

    * Connects your local repository to the remote you set up in the above steps.
    * **NOTE:** replace "NameOfYourRepository" and "URLofYourRepository" with the name of your repository and its URL

* You are now ready to perform the customization edits in this directory (you can use a text editor of choice now don't have to stay in terminal - just locate the folder in the finder and open file in text editor)


### Create Data Storage Directory

This area will be where all current Islandora production data is to be stored. This includes the Apache `/var/www/html` directory and the appropriate Fedora `/usr/local/fedora/data` subdirectories outlined below.

**ON your remote ISLE Host server:**

* Create a directory named `yourdomain-data` (where "yourdomain" is your server domain name). This directory can be anywhere (e.g. an NFS)

    * Example:  `digital-collections.yourdomain.com-data`

---

### Migration Export Checklist

* In the `/opt/ISLE/config` directory create a new sub-directory (you can call this `current_prod_islandora_config`)

* Copy the files from your current running institutional Islandora Production server(s) into this directory following the [Migration Export Checklist](migration_export_checklist.md) of materials on either the local workstation or remote server (in case the data involved is too large for your local workstation) as directed.

    * **Noting** that most likely the Apache data (`/var/www/html`) & Fedora data (`/usr/local/fedora/data`) will stay on your designated remote ISLE host server storage area not your local laptop used for creating the ISLE config.

* These copied files will be the source for edits and merges - just to be very clear, please **don't work directly on these files in your currently running production Islandora system!**

* To be even more clear, after following the checklist, you should now have two nearly identical `/config` subdirectories
    * **A.** copied from the cloned ISLE repository and renamed with your domain e.g. `yourdomain-config or digital-collections.yourdomain.com-config`
    * **B.** copied from your currently running Islandora environment. e.g. `current_prod_islandora_config`

### Migration Merge Checklist

The **goal** is to merge all site-specific data (domain names, variables, usernames, passwords, etc..) AND all site-specific customizations or settings from the files in directory B. into the matching files in directory A.

* Compare the data and settings of the files found within directory **B.** `current_prod_islandora_config`, and then merge, edit or copy as necessary with the templated settings found within the renamed directory **A.** `yourdomain-config` as guided in the [Migration Merge Checklist](migration_merge_checklist.md).

* Customizations: (_optional_) Carefully compare the following most frequently customized files with the new, default versions found within your new ISLE config folder. Use a "Diff" tool (example: [Beyond Compare](https://www.scootersoftware.com/download.php) to merge any desired customizations from your production Islandora files to persist within the new ISLE config folder of files:

   * Compare and merge the Solr files: `schema.xml`
   * Compare and merge the Solr files: `solrconfig.xml`
   * Compare and merge the Solr files: `stopwords`
   * Compare and merge the Fedora GSearch Islandora Transform (XSLTs) folder of files: `islandora_transforms`

### Docker env file:

* Edit the .env file and change the values of COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME, BASE_DOMAIN, and CONTAINER_SHORT_ID. e.g. for a production site you may use:

    `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=isleproduction`

    `BASE_DOMAIN=mydomain.edu`

    `CONTAINER_SHORT_ID=prod`

**Please note:** Much of the file is already with comments guiding the enduser to key areas or files to edit or modify accordingly.

---


## Final steps

* Now that all the changes are made (be sure to save), ISLE should be ready to test. First you'll need to push these changes to your private code repository.

    * Open a terminal - `cd` to the config directory you've been making the changes in...

    * `git status`  this will show you all the files that have been modified and ready to be added to your private repo along with handy paths for the next steps.

    * `git add /pathtoyourmodifiedfile` (replace "pathtoyourmodifiedfile" with the path to your config directory)

    * run these:

    `git add apache`
    `git add fedora`
    `git add mysql`
    `git add proxy`
    `git add solr`
    `git add docker-compose.yml`

    * run `git status` again - everything should be in green now as all modified files have been added - if anything's still red use git add and the path to add it

    * then run `git commit -m "initial config commit"` inside the double quotes is the commit message you can say whatever you want in this message - so for example if this is the config for your dev instance you could say that...

    * run `git push origin master` this will push all your changes to the repo further changes should be made on branches for different servers or to master branch for this same server


--------

##Clone Custom Configuration to Host Server

* Open a terminal - ssh into your host server using the `islandora` user

* `cd` to `/opt/ISLE/config/`

* because your customizations are in a **private** repository, you'll need to add this islandora user's `id_rsa.pub` key to the repository via the website.

* This key is found in `/home/islandora/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

* One can simply run `cat /home/islandora/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` and copy the output (ensure no whitespaces or extra returns)

* Go to the repository web site with a browser and locate your private repository.

      * locate the ssh key entry location (in Bitbucket this is in Settings / Access Keys /
      * **add** an ssh key w/ the label **islandora host server** paste in the key text and click **Add Key**

* Back at your terminal command line, run `git clone URLpathtoyourremoteprivaterepo.git .` (replacing "URLpathtoyourremoteprivaterepo" with the URL to the repository provided by the website)

* `cd` into the newly cloned directory - this is a good time to check that the ISLE directory contains your `yourdomain-config` directory and that it reflects all the edits and customizations.

## Spin up ISLE containers!

### Review or pull down ISLE Docker images

_Please Note: You may have already done this in setting up the host server manually and / or with Ansible. However it is always a good idea to review and check using the first command below._

* Check if all ISLE images have been downloaded
  * `docker image ls`

  * If yes, then proceed to Step 7

  * If not, then pull the latest images:
    * `docker-compose pull`

---
### Spin up the proxy container

* `cd /opt/ISLE/yourdomain-config`
* `docker-compose up -d proxy`


### Spin up the mysql container and import production database(s)

* `cd /opt/ISLE/yourdomain-config`
* `docker-compose up -d mysql`

Two methods for connecting to the MySQL Database (GUI / CLI) pick one.

1. One may use SQL GUI clients e.g. Sequel Pro, Navicat, PHPMyAdmin etc. and import the production Drupal website database(s)

2. If the above not practical, one may connect to the MySQL container and run the following.

    * `docker exec -it isle-mysql-institution bash` to connect to the container
        * swap out `institution` for the correct container name.
    * appropriate mysql commands here: consult MySQL documentation - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/

2a. (_optional_) Only follow this if you have **not** first run `drush cc all` and then exported the MySQL databases or if you have **not** exported the MySQL databases excluding the contents of any table with `cache` in the name.

The following are STEPS, not literal commands to prepare your db for ISLE (_doing this because we've found there are errors using exported db from production because of caches - causes problems - steps below help you remove this problem_)

* import the production databases into the isle-mysql-institution container (_with errors being ignored_)
* truncate all tables that start with `cache` on the isle-mysql-institution container
* export this new database to the `mysql` directory on the isle host server
* delete all tables (_not the database itself_) on the isle-mysql-institution container
* Reimport the new lighter database to the isle-mysql container

---

### Spin up the fedora container and start the reindex processes

Staying within `/opt/ISLE/yourdomain-config`
* `docker-compose up -d fedora`
    * _optional_ check if fedora is running properly e.g. `http://isle-prod-project.institution:8080/manager/html`
* `docker exec -it isle-fedora-institution bash`

* Follow the steps outlined in the [Migration Reindex Process Guide](migration_reindex_process.md)
    * Follow the steps outlined in the Reindex Fedora RI (1 of 3) section
    * Follow the steps outlined in the Reindex SQL database (2 of 3) section
    * Pause here before attempting the steps within the Reindex Solr (3 of 3) section.
    * Move onto the next section in this guide, `Spin up apache container`.

---

### Spin up apache container

* Staying within `/opt/ISLE/yourdomain-config`

* `docker-compose up -d apache`

* `docker exec -it isle-apache-institution bash`

*  Run the vset script
    * `cd /var/www/html`
    * `./vsets.sh`  

* Edit .htaccess to enforce https
    * `echo "SetEnvIf X-Forwarded-Proto https HTTPS=on" | tee -a /var/www/html/.htaccess`

* Check if the site is now is running properly by opening a web browser and navigating to your new ISLE domain e.g. `https://isle-prod-project.institution`

* Please note while you may be able to see objects being displayed, metadata and search results will be empty until you run the last step in the Reindex process.

**Troubleshooting Note** Sites migrating *from* a version of Drupal prior to 7.50 may need to update their mysql tables to utf8mb4.  On the new site, go to `https://isle-prod-project.institution/admin/reports/status` (you will need to be logged in as a Drupal Admin) and look for the following error:

![Database 4 byte UTF-8 support Enabled, but database tables need conversion](../assets/utf8mb4-error.png)

Instructions for converting the Drupal mysql database are available on the [Drupal website](https://www.drupal.org/project/utf8mb4_convert)

---

### Spin up solr container and complete the reindex processes

* Staying within `/opt/ISLE/yourdomain-config`
* `docker-compose up -d solr`
  * (_optional_) check if solr is running properly e.g. `http://isle-prod-project.institution:8777/manager/html`

* `docker exec -it isle-fedora-institution bash` **NOTE FEDORA NOT SOLR!**

* Follow the steps outlined in the [Migration Reindex Process Guide](migration_reindex_process.md)
    * Follow the steps outlined only in the Reindex Solr (3 of 3) section.
       * (_Ensure that Tomcat and Fedora are running._)

* Check the results on the site using Islandora simple search or the appropriate search method.

Congratulations you should have successfully migrated your production Islandora site to ISLE!!
